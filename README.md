### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

### Description
In this project, _Python_ is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” _Chicago, New York City,_ and _Washington_. 
- The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience. 
- According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.

### Files used
# Below files are used to analyze data in this project.
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The _Chicago_ and _New York City_ files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year
